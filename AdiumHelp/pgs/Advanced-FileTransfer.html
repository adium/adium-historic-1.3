					File Transfer
				</h1>
			</div>
			<p>
				Adium's file transfer is not complete and may work sometimes and not others. We are very aware of these issues and the importance of file transfer support, but unfortunately the complicated and varied nature of file transfer means that file transfer support is limited.
			</p>
			<p>
				Adium uses the <a href="http://trac.adium.im/wiki/LibPurple">libpurple</a> library to implement almost all the protocols that it supports. Most problems are caused by bugs or missing features in libpurple; as such, there's nothing we can do about them. These issues affect other applications (specifically, they affect any application based upon libpurple), and if they were simple to solve, we can guarantee you they would already have been. We appreciate your understanding.

							If AIM file transfer is flaky or doesn't work at all for you, you may need to forward ports 5190 through 5200 to your computer in your router, NAT, cable modem, or DSL modem.
						</p>
						<p>
							In addition, if you use a firewall, you need to open ports 5190 through 5200 for outgoing connections (to receive) and incoming connections (to send).
						</p>
						<p>
							<b>Mac OS X firewall</b>
						</p>
						<p>
							Mac OS X's built-in firewall, if you've turned it on, blocks incoming connections except on ports you've explicitly allowed. You'll need to allow incoming connections to Adium in order to send files.
						</p>

							<i>In Mac OS X 10.5 (Leopard) and later:</i>
						</p>
						<div style="margin-left: 2em">
						<ol>
							<li>Choose System Preferences from the Apple () menu.
							</li>
							<li>Click Security.
							</li>
							<li>Click on the Firewall tab.
							</li>
							<li>If “Allow all incoming connections” is selected, the firewall is off, so you can stop right here.
							</li>
							<li>If “Allow only essential services” is selected, select “Set access for specific services and applications”.
							</li>
							<li>Click the + button.
							</li>
							<li>Hold down the ⌘ key, and while holding that down, drag Adium from the Dock (at the bottom of the screen) to the Open sheet.
							</li>
							<li>Click Add.
							</li>
							<li>The column on the right should read, for Adium's row, “Allow incoming connections”. If if it reads “Block incoming connections”, click on it, then change it to “Allow”.

						<p>
							MSN file transfers in the protocol supported by libpurple go through the Microsoft server. They are therefore very reliable but also quite slow. MSN7 and other MSN clients support a direct person-to-person transfer as is used in AIM, which is not yet supported by libpurple.
						</p>
						<p>
							The libpurple developers don't know if or when they will ever support any of the peer-to-peer file transfer methods available in the MSN protocol. Therefore we don't know if or when this will make it into an Adium release.

							Why doesn't file transfer work over Google Talk?
						</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td valign="top">
						<p>
							Because Google Talk uses a different protocol, called Jingle, for file transfers (as well as voice calls - <a href="http://groups.google.ca/group/google-talk-open/browse_thread/thread/61ad293b4790faeb/821b891053a55a0b?lnk=arm#821b891053a55a0b">here</a> are the gritty details). The Google Talk servers disallow file transfers using the protocol that other Jabber services use. Note that although Google promised to release their specifications for this protocol back in 2007, they have not yet done so, so we are unable to implement it, even if we had the time to do it.
