Otherwise, don't bother to try it—it won't help.

						<p>
							If you've installed plug-ins or other Adium Xtras, they may be causing your problem (depending on the problem - a contact list style won't cause message view problems, for example). Try this: Quit Adium, then remove the Xtras, then launch Adium again. If that works, start moving Xtras back (relaunching Adium after each one) until the problem reoccurs; then you've found the bad one. Please don't create a ticket for a non-standard Xtra. The Adium team isn't responsible for Xtras that aren't bundled with Adium, and creating a ticket isn't an effective way to get the Xtra fixed. Please report the problem to the Xtra's author.
						</p>
						<p>
							Information on removing and (re)installing Xtras is available in the <a href="Advanced-AdiumXtras.html">Adium Xtras documentation</a>.

						<p>
							Corrupt or old preferences can be a good source of crashes and other odd behavior. It may also happen that you've managed to configure your Adium in such a way to discover a bug that requires a specific combination of preferences to trigger. It's easy to rule out both of these by trying a fresh set of preferences; see the <a href="FAQ-Preferences.html">Adium preferences documentation</a>.
						</p>
						<p>
						<b>This is a very common fix for many issues and therefore is a highly recommended step</b> - please try it even if you don't want to trash your preferences altogether since it can at least help narrow down the problem and may provide alternate solutions. In many cases where this solves the problem we do not have the manpower to discover why the preferences were causing a problem (as this can be a lengthy process), so your only solution may be to lose all or some of your preferences.

						<p>
							Occasionally, an issue in Adium can be caused by a strange setting for your OS X user, or other installed software (especially system mods and hacks). Temporarily creating a new user (in System Preferences -&gt; Accounts) is the best way to check against these issues. Create the account, logs out of your account (Apple Menu → Log Out), and log into the new one. If the problem doesn't occur on the other user account, then you know it's something in your current account. If you don't know where to go from there, <a href="http://trac.adium.im/wiki/ContactUs">Contact Us</a> and we'll help you narrow the field.

							In some cases the problems encountered in Adium can actually be a result of a server-side problem. These problems can be confirmed by logging in to your account using the equivalent mainline client; for example if the problem is with MSN, login with Microsoft Messenger to see if it occurs using that client as well. If the problem persists across different clients, then there is likely nothing we can do to solve the problem except wait for the server issues to be repaired; please do not open new tickets regarding these kinds of problems.

						<p>
If Adium prompts you for your password every time you connect, and checking the “remember my password” box does not work, open the Keychain Access application and run Keychain First Aid or Repair from the Keychain Access menu. If that does not solve the problem, you can also try deleting each Adium entry that you see in the Keychain Access application.
						</p>
						<p>
If you run an application “slimmer” that removes code from your applications that does not match your computer's CPU architecture, it can cause the same symptoms as described here. Re-downloading and installing a fresh, un-slimmed Adium should solve that problem.
