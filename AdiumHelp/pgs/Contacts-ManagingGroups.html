							Note that if you drag the group too far out of the list in any direction, it may pop out of the list (see “Disassociating Groups” below). This is a feature, and is easy to fix when you don't intend it (see “Re-associating Groups”).

						<p>
							If you really want to rename the group on the server, you'll need to do it yourself. Be aware that this is risky, as some services flake out when you try to move a lot of contacts at once, and may drop some of your contacts (AIM used to be notorious for this). You should write down all the contact names in TextEdit first.

							It's possible to remove one or more groups from the main Contact List window and have them floating around separately. Simply drag them out of the Contact List window. You will need to hold down ⌘ when you do this, if you use your Contact List in a borderless window style (i.e., not Regular Window).
						</p>
						<p>
							Alternately, right-click (or control-click) on a group and choose Detach Group from the menu which appears.
						</p>
						<p>
							Also, groups snap together—they don't have to be alone. Just move one group next to another, and it will snap to it.
