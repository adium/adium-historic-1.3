			<p>
				Adium version 0.80 and later have Growl support built-in, and since version 1.0, the default configuration has had Growl turned on for several events by default:
			</p>
			<div style="margin-left: 2em">
			<ul>
				<li>Contact signs on
				</li>
				<li>Message received (Background Chat)
				</li>
				<li>File transfer requested
				</li>
				<li>File transfer completed successfully
				</li>
				<li>File transfer failed
				</li>
				<li>Error occurs
				</li>
			</ul>
			</div>
			<p>
				To turn some of these off, or to make Adium post additional <a href="http://growl.info">Growl</a> notifications, you need to set up one or more events (either on a contact, or globally in the Preferences) that post a Growl notification.
			</p>

		</center>
			<p>
				If Growl isn't installed, then the first time Adium tries to post a Growl notification, it will ask to install Growl. Adium 0.89.1 will install Growl 0.7.4.
			</p>
			<p>
				If it still isn't working after you do that, open the Growl pane, and make sure Adium is listed on the Applications tab and that notifications from it are enabled.
